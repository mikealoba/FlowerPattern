# FlowerPattern

I created this flower pattern using R.

Patterns do exist in nature. Some are visible, some are not.

Visible patterns include the shape of the snowflakes and figures found in leaves and flowers.

Interestingly, some of these patterns are governed by a math equation (e.g. golden ratio).

R is a programming language used for doing some serious, sometimes boring, statistical math analysis.

Using R in studying statistical math needs not to be boring.

R can also be used to do some fun artistic flower patterns in nature.

This flower pattern is the one being studied by scientists (particularly botanists).

Phyllotaxis is the term used generally for the study of patterns in plants (leaves, flowers, barks etc.).
